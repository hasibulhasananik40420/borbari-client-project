          WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR SPOUSE IS TOXIC

          Concern and confusion about your relationship are completely
          understandable. On the one hand, people say things like: No marriage
          is perfect. Marriage requires work and self-sacrifice. Every marriage
          experiences ups and downs. On the other hand, you might be wondering:
          Are my spouse and I an explosive combination? Is my spouse toxic? What
          do I do now?
